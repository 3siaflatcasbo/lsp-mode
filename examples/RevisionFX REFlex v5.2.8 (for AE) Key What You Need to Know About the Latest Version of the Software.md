## What is RevisionFX REFlex and what are its features?
 
RevisionFX REFlex is a plug-in for Adobe After Effects that allows you to create visually stunning morphs and warps with an easy-to-use interface. REFlex uses the host program's own splines to direct the warping and morphing, so you don't need to deal with complicated meshes or grids.
 
REFlex also features automatic image registration, which means it can align and blend images automatically without manual feature-matching. This makes it easier and faster to create smooth transitions between different images.
