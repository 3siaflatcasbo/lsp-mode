In this article, we will explain why this error occurs and how to fix it with some simple steps. We will also provide some tips on how to avoid this error in the future and enjoy the game without any problems.
 
## Why Does the No Ship Available Error Occur?
 
The no ship available error is caused by a bug in the cracked version of Anno 2070 that affects the online features of the game. The crack disables the connection to the Ubisoft servers, which are required for some aspects of the game, such as voting, monthly missions, and ark functionality. The ark is a special ship that stores your upgrades and items and can be used across different maps and modes.
 
Without the connection to the servers, the game cannot recognize your ships and ports as valid trading assets. Therefore, it does not let you set up trading routes or complete some missions that require trading. This error can ruin your gameplay experience and prevent you from progressing in the game.
 
## How to Fix the No Ship Available Error?
 
There are two possible ways to fix the no ship available error in Anno 2070 crack. The first one is to patch the game with an update that fixes the bug and restores the online features. The second one is to install a mod that adds new features and options to the game and bypasses the need for online connection.
