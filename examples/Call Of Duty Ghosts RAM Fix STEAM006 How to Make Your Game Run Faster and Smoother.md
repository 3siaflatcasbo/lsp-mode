# How to Play Call of Duty: Ghosts with 4GB RAM Using STEAM006's Fix
 
Call of Duty: Ghosts is a popular first-person shooter game that was released in 2013. However, many PC gamers were disappointed to find out that the game requires 6GB of RAM and a 64-bit OS to run. This means that many players with older or less powerful systems could not play the game at all.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem. A user named STEAM006 has created a fix that removes the RAM limitation from the game and allows you to play it even if you have only 4GB of RAM. This fix also improves the performance and stability of the game, as well as fixes some other issues such as weapon and texture flickering, mouse acceleration, and FPS drops.
