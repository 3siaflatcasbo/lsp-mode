The album features Prince's final top 10 single, "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World", which is a graceful and gentle song with a '70s soft-R&B falsetto. However, the rest of the album is harder, friskier, and just plain weirder than that hit might have you expect. The album showcases Prince's versatility and creativity in various genres and styles, such as funk rock, hip hop, soul, pop, and psychedelic.
 
Some of the highlights of the album include "P. Control", a salacious and admiring tale of a self-sufficient woman; "Endorphinmachine", a hecka slammin' slab of guitar funk; "Eye Hate U", a seductive and conflicted psychodrama; "We March", a militant anti-racist protest anthem; and "Gold", a soaring and uplifting ballad that closes the album.
 
The Gold Experience received critical acclaim from music critics, who praised Prince's musical genius and originality. The album charted at number six on the Billboard 200 and number two on the Top R&B Albums. The singles "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World", "I Hate U", and "Gold" charted on the Billboard Hot 100 at numbers three, 12, and 88 respectively.
 
The Gold Experience is widely considered as one of Prince's best albums in the '90s and as close as he came to a masterpiece in that decade. It is also a testament to his artistic integrity and defiance against the record label's commercial expectations, as he released the album amid his contractual dispute with Warner Bros. Records.

The Gold Experience also features some interesting interludes and skits that add to the album's concept and narrative. The album is introduced by a female voice that identifies herself as "the NPG operator", who guides the listener through the "gold experience". The NPG operator also appears throughout the album to announce the track numbers and titles, as well as to provide some commentary and humor.
 
The album also includes a hidden track called "Segue", which is a phone conversation between Prince and his then-wife Mayte Garcia. The track reveals some of the personal and emotional aspects of Prince's life at the time, such as his love for Mayte, his frustration with the music industry, and his spiritual beliefs.
