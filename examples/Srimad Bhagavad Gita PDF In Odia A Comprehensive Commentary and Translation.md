The Srimad Bhagavad Gita in Odia is not only a religious text, but also a cultural treasure of Odisha. The Odia language has a rich literary tradition that dates back to the 8th century CE, and the Gita has been translated and interpreted by many Odia poets and scholars over the centuries. Some of the most famous Odia versions of the Gita are:

- [Atma Gita by Jagannath Das](https://archive.org/details/AtmaGitaByJagannathDas): This is a poetic rendition of the Gita in Odia by Jagannath Das, who was a 15th century saint and poet. He is also the author of the Odia Bhagavata Purana, which is considered as the pinnacle of Odia literature. His Atma Gita is a concise and lucid summary of the Gita's teachings, written in simple and elegant verses.
- [Sarala Mahabharata by Sarala Das](https://archive.org/details/SaralaMahabharata): This is an epic retelling of the Mahabharata in Odia by Sarala Das, who was a 15th century poet and scholar. He is regarded as the father of Odia literature and the first Odia prose writer. His Sarala Mahabharata is a unique and original version of the Mahabharata, which includes many stories and characters that are not found in the Sanskrit original. His version of the Gita is also different from the Sanskrit one, as he adds his own commentary and interpretation to the verses.
- [Gita Govinda by Jayadeva](https://archive.org/details/GitaGovindaByJayadeva): This is a lyrical masterpiece of Odia literature by Jayadeva, who was a 12th century poet and musician. He is famous for his devotion to Lord Krishna and his love for his wife Padmavati. His Gita Govinda is a collection of 24 songs that describe the love story of Krishna and Radha, and their separation and reunion. The songs are full of beauty, emotion and eroticism, and are considered as one of the finest examples of Sanskrit poetry. The Gita Govinda is not directly related to the Srimad Bhagavad Gita, but it expresses the same theme of divine love and devotion.

These are some of the most popular and influential Odia versions of the Gita that have inspired generations of Odia readers and writers. Reading these versions will enrich your understanding and appreciation of the Gita's message and its relevance to your life.
