If you are a fan of R.L. Stine's Goosebumps books, you might enjoy watching Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween, a movie based on the popular horror series for children. The movie follows two boys who find a magic book that brings a ventriloquist's dummy named Slappy to life. Slappy then unleashes a horde of monsters, witches, ghouls and other creatures from the Goosebumps books on Halloween night. The boys must team up with their sister and their neighbor to stop Slappy and his minions before they take over the world.
 
Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween is a sequel to the 2015 movie Goosebumps, which also featured Slappy as the main antagonist. However, you don't need to watch the first movie to enjoy the second one, as they have different stories and characters. The movie is rated PG for some scary scenes and mild language, but it is also full of humor and adventure. The movie stars Jeremy Ray Taylor, Madison Iseman, Caleel Harris, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Ken Jeong and Chris Parnell. Jack Black, who played R.L. Stine in the first movie, makes a cameo appearance as the author's voice.[^1^]

Some of the positive reviews praised the movie for its fun and spooky atmosphere, its homage to the Goosebumps books and its appeal to children and families. Tara McNamara of Common Sense Media gave the movie 4 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Light frights in funny, tween-friendly creepfest.\"[^2^] She also highlighted the movie's diverse cast and teamwork theme. Matthew Bond of The Mail on Sunday gave the movie 3 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"Goosebumps 2 is a lively and colourful ghost train ride, with some well-judged scares that would have been at home in its 1980s Amblin forerunners, such as The Goonies and Young Sherlock...\"[^1^]
 
Some of the negative reviews criticized the movie for its weak story, bland characters, cheap scares and lack of Jack Black's presence. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian gave the movie 2 out of 5 stars and wrote: \"This insipid follow-up to the first Goosebumps film dispenses with any pretence at plot.\"[^5^] He also called Slappy \"a charmless bore\". Johnny Oleksinski of The New York Post gave the movie 1.5 out of 4 stars and wrote: \"The sequel is so bland and uninspired that it makes last week's \"The House With a Clock in Its Walls\" look like \"The Exorcist\".\" He also lamented that Jack Black only appeared briefly at the end of the movie.
