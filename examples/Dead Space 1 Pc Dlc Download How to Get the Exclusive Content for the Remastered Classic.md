## How to Download and Install Dead Space 1 PC DLC for Free?
 
To download and install the Dead Space 1 PC DLC for free, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Download the unofficial patches:** The first step is to download the unofficial patches that enable the DLC content on PC. These patches were created by fans who extracted the DLC files from the console versions of the game and modified them to work on PC. You can find the links to download these patches on this [Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/deadspace/mods/4). There are two patches: one for the *Astronaut Pack* and one for the *Pedestrian Pack*. Download both of them and extract them to your desktop or any other folder.
2. **Backup your save files:** The next step is to backup your save files before installing the patches. This is because the patches may overwrite your existing save files or cause compatibility issues with them. To backup your save files, go to your Documents folder on your PC and find the folder called `EAGames\Dead Space\`. Inside this folder, you will see several files with names like `ds_01_slot_01.dsav`. These are your save files. Copy them to another folder or a USB drive for safekeeping.
3. **Install the patches:** The final step is 8cf37b1e13
