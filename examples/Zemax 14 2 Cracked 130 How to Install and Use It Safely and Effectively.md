# Zemax 14 2 Cracked 130: A Pirated Version of OpticStudio Software
 
Zemax 14 2 Cracked 130 is a term that refers to a pirated version of Zemax OpticStudio, a software for optical design and analysis. Zemax OpticStudio is the industry standard for optical, illumination, and laser system design in universities and companies around the world[^4^]. It allows users to simulate, optimize, and tolerance their optical systems, as well as analyze the effects of structural and thermal loads[^5^].
 
However, some people may try to obtain Zemax OpticStudio without paying for a license, by using cracked versions that bypass the security features of the software. Zemax 14 2 Cracked 130 is one such example, which can be found on some websites that offer illegal downloads of software and media[^1^] [^2^] [^3^]. These websites may also contain malware, viruses, or other harmful content that can damage the user's computer or compromise their personal information.

Using Zemax 14 2 Cracked 130 or any other pirated version of Zemax OpticStudio is not only illegal, but also unethical and risky. It violates the intellectual property rights of Zemax, the company that develops and supports OpticStudio. It also deprives Zemax of the revenue that enables them to invest in research and development, customer service, and product improvement. Moreover, it exposes the user to potential legal consequences, technical issues, and security threats.
 
Therefore, it is strongly recommended that anyone who wants to use Zemax OpticStudio should obtain a legitimate license from Zemax or an authorized reseller. This way, they can enjoy the full benefits of the software, such as access to updates, technical support, training resources, and community forums. They can also avoid any legal or ethical problems that may arise from using pirated software.

## What is Zemax OpticStudio?
 
Zemax OpticStudio is a software for optical design and analysis that can model everything from imaging optics to illumination, including stray light analysis. It has an intuitive user interface that includes easy-to-learn tools and wizards that enable efficient simulation and design of any optical system. It also has a powerful ray tracing engine that can handle complex geometries and materials, as well as a robust optimization and tolerancing algorithm that can ensure manufacturability and performance of the optical system.
 
Zemax OpticStudio comes in three editions: Standard, Premium, and Enterprise. The Standard edition offers the basic functionality for optical design and analysis, such as sequential and non-sequential ray tracing, optimization, tolerancing, physical optics propagation, polarization analysis, and more. The Premium edition adds advanced features such as lasers and fibers, phosphor and fluorescence modeling, dynamic CAD integrations, and more. The Enterprise edition includes all the features of the Premium edition, plus the Structural Thermal Analysis & Results (STAR) module that enables users to quickly analyze the impacts of structural and thermal loads on their optical system.
 
## What are some features of Zemax OpticStudio?
 
Zemax OpticStudio has many features that make it a versatile and powerful software for optical design and analysis. Some of these features are:
