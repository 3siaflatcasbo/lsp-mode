# Organic Reaction Mechanisms by Ahluwalia: A Comprehensive Guide for Students and Researchers
 
Organic reaction mechanisms are the detailed steps that explain how organic molecules undergo chemical transformations. They are essential for understanding the synthesis, reactivity, and properties of organic compounds. Organic reaction mechanisms also provide insights into the molecular basis of life, as many biological processes involve organic reactions.

One of the most popular and widely used books on organic reaction mechanisms is *Organic Reaction Mechanisms* by V.K. Ahluwalia and R.K. Parashar. This book, first published in 2002, covers various types of organic reactions and rearrangements with emphasis on their applications in synthesis. It also includes a summary of oxidation and reduction of organic compounds, a discussion of the most common reaction intermediates, and numerous examples and problems to help students practice and master the topic.
 
The book is divided into ten chapters, each focusing on a major class of organic reactions, such as aliphatic C-H bond functionalization, cycloaddition reactions, nucleophilic substitutions and additions on sp3- and sp2-hybridized carbons, reactivity of the alpha-hydrogen to carbonyl groups, and rearrangements. Each chapter begins with a brief review of the basic concepts and principles of organic chemistry, followed by a detailed description of the mechanisms and factors influencing the reactions. The book also provides references to the original literature sources for further reading and research.
 
*Organic Reaction Mechanisms* by Ahluwalia and Parashar is a valuable resource for graduate and postgraduate students of chemistry who want to learn and master the fundamentals and applications of organic reaction mechanisms. It is also a useful reference for researchers and professionals who are interested in exploring new areas of organic chemistry or preparing for competitive examinations.

## Chapter 1: Bonding in Organic Compounds
 
The first chapter of the book introduces the basic concepts of bonding in organic compounds, such as hybridization, resonance, tautomerism, and molecular orbital theory. It explains how the structure and geometry of organic molecules are determined by the type and number of bonds between the atoms. It also discusses the factors that affect the stability and reactivity of organic molecules, such as bond strength, bond polarity, bond order, and bond angle.
 
The chapter provides examples of different types of organic compounds, such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, heterocycles, and functional groups. It illustrates how to draw the Lewis structures, resonance structures, and molecular orbital diagrams of these compounds. It also shows how to predict the physical and chemical properties of these compounds based on their bonding characteristics.
 
The chapter concludes with a summary of the key points and a set of problems to test the understanding of the readers. The problems include multiple choice questions, short answer questions, and mechanism problems. The solutions to the problems are given at the end of the book.
