- Critical bug fix for autorouter: The autorouter is a feature that automatically connects the components on a PCB based on the schematic diagram. In previous versions, the autorouter sometimes created invalid connections that could cause short circuits or other problems. This bug has been fixed in 0.9.4 and the autorouter now produces correct and reliable results.
- Improved compatibility with different operating systems: Fritzing 0.9.4 has been tested and verified to work on various platforms, including Windows 10 and 11, Mac OS X High Sierra, Catalina, Big Sur and Monterey (Intel and M1 with Rosetta), Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and 22.04, Fedora 30, and Linux Mint 20[^2^]. The installation process has also been simplified and streamlined for different systems.
- Updated parts library: The parts library is a collection of components that users can drag and drop into their projects. The parts library is now stored online at GitHub and is automatically checked for updates[^2^]. This means users will always have access to the latest and most accurate parts available. The parts library also includes translations for various languages, such as Deutsch (German), English , EspaÃ±ol (Spanish), FranÃ§ais (French), Italiano (Italian), Nederlands (Dutch), PortuguÃªs (eu) (Portuguese EU), PortuguÃªs (br) (Portuguese BR), æ¥æ¬èª (Japanese), ä¸­æ (ç®ä½) (Chinese Simplified), æ­£é«ä¸­æ (ç¹é«) (Chinese Traditional), Ð£ÐºÑÐ°ÑÐ½ÑÑÐºÐ° Ð¼Ð¾Ð²Ð° (Ukrainian), Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ (Russian), ÄeÅ¡tina (Czech), íêµ­ì´ (Korean), ÎÎ»Î»Î·Î½Î¹ÎºÎ¬ (Greek), slovenÄina (Slovak), romÃ¢nÄ (Romanian), TÃ¼rkÃ§e (Turkish), ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÑÐºÐ¸ (Bulgarian), à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦²à¦¾ (Bengali)[^1^].
