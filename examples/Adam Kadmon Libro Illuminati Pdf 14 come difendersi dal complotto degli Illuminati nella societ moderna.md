## Who is Adam Kadmon?
 
Adam Kadmon is a Hebrew term that means "primordial man" or "universal man". According to Kabbalah, a mystical branch of Judaism, Adam Kadmon is the first emanation of God, the highest level of existence, and the blueprint for all creation. He contains within himself all the divine attributes, such as wisdom, love, power, and justice. He is also the source of all souls, which are sparks of his light.
 
However, Adam Kadmon is not a physical being, but a spiritual one. He is not the same as Adam HaRishon (the first Adam), who was created from dust and lived in the Garden of Eden. Adam Kadmon is a cosmic principle, a metaphysical concept, and a symbol of unity and perfection.
 
Adam Kadmon has also been linked to other traditions and figures, such as:

- The Anthropos (the original man) of Gnosticism, a religious movement that claimed to have secret knowledge of God and salvation.
- The Primal Adam (al-Insan al-Kamil) of Sufism, a mystical branch of Islam that emphasizes love and devotion to God.
- The Perfect Man (ho teleios anthropos) of Hermeticism, a philosophical and occult system that originated in ancient Egypt and Greece.
- The Christ (the anointed one) of Christianity, who is believed to be the son of God and the savior of humanity.
- The Buddha (the awakened one) of Buddhism, who attained enlightenment and taught the path to liberation from suffering.

All these traditions share a common theme: the idea that there is a higher state of being that transcends the limitations of the physical world and connects us to our divine origin. Adam Kadmon represents this ideal state, which we can aspire to achieve through spiritual practice.
 
## What is his connection to the Illuminati?
 
The Illuminati (the enlightened ones) is a name given to various groups and individuals who claim to have access to secret knowledge and power. The most famous and controversial of these groups is the Bavarian Illuminati, which was founded in 1776 by Adam Weishaupt, a German professor of law and philosophy. The Bavarian Illuminati was a secret society that aimed to overthrow the existing political and religious order and establish a new world based on reason, freedom, and equality.
 
The Bavarian Illuminati was influenced by various sources, such as Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism, Enlightenment philosophy, and Kabbalah. One of their symbols was the Eye of Providence (or the All-Seeing Eye), which represents God's omniscience and guidance. This symbol can also be seen on the U.S. dollar bill, which has led some people to believe that the Illuminati has infiltrated the American government and other institutions.
 
However, the Bavarian Illuminati was not the only group that used this name or symbol. There have been many other groups and individuals throughout history who have claimed to be part of or inspired by the Illuminati, such as:

- The Alumbrados (the enlightened ones) of Spain, a mystical movement that emerged in the 16th century and practiced meditation and contemplation.
- The Roshaniyya (the illuminated ones) of Afghanistan, a religious sect that was founded in the 16th century by Bayazid Ansari, who claimed to 8cf37b1e13
