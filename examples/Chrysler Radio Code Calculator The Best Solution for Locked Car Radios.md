- Contacting your dealer or the manufacturer and providing them with your VIN number and proof of ownership. They may be able to give you the code over the phone or by email, but they may also charge you a fee or ask you to visit their service center.
- Looking for the code in your car's manual, glove box, trunk, or under the hood. Sometimes the code may be written on a sticker or a card and placed in these locations by the dealer or the previous owner.
- Searching for the code online on forums, websites, or databases. Some people may share their codes or offer to help others who need them. However, this method is not very reliable or secure, as you may get wrong codes or encounter scammers.
